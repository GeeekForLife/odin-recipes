   <h1>Geeks Famous Ribs</h1>
     <P>This is without a doubt one of <em>my favorite</em> dishes to cook, Its <em>extremely easy</em>
     to make too! People often wonder why I boil my ribs before i bake them. This method is called parboiling
     it allows all the fat and connective tissue to render down leaving you with <em>tender delectible</em> meat. This 
     recipe is <strong>extremely important</strong> to me and i am very proud of it, your friends and family will <strong>love</strong> it.</P>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>1 slab pork ribs with bone</li>
     <li>4 tbsp of garlic powder</li>
     <li>1 large onion</li>
     <li>4 tsp salt</li>
     <li>1 tbsp black pepper</li>
     <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
     <li>2 tsp onion powder</li>
     <li>12-16 oz of BBQ sauce</li>
     <li>2 tsp brown sugar</li>
   </ul>
  
  <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Crack open your package of ribs and cut the slab in half. fill a large pot
        add your vegetables and a quarter of your spices to the pot and bring to a boil
        turn your heat down and continue boiling for 55 mins. 
        <h3>Note!</h3>
        <em>Be <strong>sure</strong> to flip the ribs over after about 25 mins of parboiling</li>
    <li>After the parboiling we are going to slap them on a baking sheet so preheat the oven 
      to 325 degrees. Re season the ribs while that is preheating, add a couple tablespoons of 
      the water from the pot so the ribs stay moist
    </li>
    <li>Now make them for 30 mins and flip doing the same on the back side</li>
    <li>This is the best part! Add your bbq sauce to the back side of the ribs and broil on high for 7-10
      minutes, or until its nice and sticky. Flip and do the same to the topside of the Ribs
    </li>
    <li>Thats it! cut the slabs up into servings and watch everyone rave about how amazing this simple recipe is</li>
